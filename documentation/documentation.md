# CPAT-Helpdesk

## POC Objective 

The aim of the project was to build a conversational question answer based chatbot. The project is as of now a POC and is to primarily serve the following functions
* act as a general helpdesk to the users, where users can inquire about the capabilities of CPAt and find the correct section of the application for their query       
* act as an alternate more intuitive interface for the users to specify and customise their queries for the data they require
* The bot is also expected to maintain a conversation flow and further probe the user for any crucial information that he may have missed.

### Sample Conversations
